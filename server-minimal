Task-Description: Minimal Ubuntu server
Task-Seeds: server-cloud-minimal

 * feature: no-follow-recommends

This seed is approximately the smallest set of packages that could be
called "an Ubuntu server".

== Packages needed for the system to operate on top of server-cloud-minimal ==

 * (needrestart)
 * (unattended-upgrades)
 * (hwctl) [amd64]          # As used by Ubuntu Pro (LP: #2072561)
 * chrony | time-daemon     # NTS enablement: LP: #2111342, chrony MIR: LP: #1744072

== Block device / filesystem tools ==

Some of these could be installed only when needed. But for now we just
always include all of them.

 * bcache-tools
 * btrfs-progs
 * cryptsetup
 * lvm2
 * mdadm
 * multipath-tools
 * open-iscsi
 * xfsprogs

== Other ==

 * ubuntu-server-minimal
 * u-boot-sifive [riscv64]  # we decided that all riscv64 installers
                            # should ship u-boot-sifive on the minimal layer
 * (kdump-tools)            # Needed to enable kernel crash dumps by default
                            # but leave as recommend to allow uninstall later.

== Blacklist ==

inetutils-telnet was introduced through MIR (LP: #2008789), but only the
-telnet package got reviewed and the other binaries from src:inetutils should
stay out of main. Related to:
