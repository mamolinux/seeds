= Desktop apps =

We use many GNOME applications as part of our desktop user interface. Rather than using Debian's meta-packages they are deliberately expanded so that we can select things a bit better.

 * gvfs-fuse          # let non-GNOME apps see GVFS via fuse
 * gvfs-backends      # let users connect to any server using nemo

 * update-manager

 * snap:prompting-client=1/stable/ubuntu-25.10

We use gnupg's pinentry support as of wily, instead of gnome-keyring as before.

 * (gpg-agent)
 * (dirmngr)

Themes: we will ship only the very best looking themes. We won't ship everything that Debian ships, just a custom package that includes our default theme.

 * (sucharu-theme-gtk)

Boot theme

 * (plymouth-theme-spinner)

Settings: we have some settings overrides by default in an unique package.
          and provide our ones, like sound settings
 * mamolinux-settings-gnome

The gstreamer1.0 packages we want to install:

= Installer integration =

ubuntu-desktop-installer (based on subiquity) needs cloud-init present in
the target install to finish setup on first boot

 * (kdump-tools)            # Needed to enable kernel crash dumps by default
                            # but leave as recommend to allow uninstall later.

= Documentation =

 * (ubuntu-docs)

= Other =

 * mamolinux-gnome-minimal # metapackage for everything here
 * (libwmf0.2-7-gtk) # provides a gdk-pixbuf loader for WMF images
