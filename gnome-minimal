We use gnupg's pinentry support as of wily, instead of gnome-keyring as before.

 * (gpg-agent)
 * (dirmngr)

the target install to finish setup on first boot

 * (kdump-tools)            # Needed to enable kernel crash dumps by default
                            # but leave as recommend to allow uninstall later.
